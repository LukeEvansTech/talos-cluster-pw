## Overview

This is a monorepository is for my home kubernetes clusters.
I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

The purpose here is to learn k8s, while practicing Gitops.

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

There is a template over at [onedr0p/cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template) if you want to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Installation

My clusters run [talos linux](https://www.talos.dev) immutable kubernetes OS. This is a semi-hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate NAS server running Unraid withg NFS/SMB shares, bulk file storage and backups.

### Core Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): self-hosted Github runners
- [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): internal Kubernetes networking plugin
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): creates SSL certificates for services in my cluster
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): automatically syncs DNS records from my cluster ingresses to a DNS provider
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/): managed Kubernetes secrets using [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer
- [rook-ceph](https://rook.io/): Cloud native distributed block storage for Kubernetes
- [sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): managed secrets for Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform which are committed to Git
- [spegel](https://github.com/XenitAB/spegel): stateless cluster local OCI registry mirror
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): backup and recovery of persistent volume claims

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches the clusters in my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my clusters based on the state of my Git repository.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the `kubernetes/${cluster}/apps` folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations. Those Flux kustomizations will generally have a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application underneath it which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged Flux applies the changes to my cluster.

This Git repository contains the following directories under [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ main            # main cluster
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ apps           # applications
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ bootstrap      # bootstrap procedures
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ flux           # core flux configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ templates      # re-useable components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ ...             # other clusters
```

### Flux Workflow

This is a high-level look how Flux deploys my applications with dependencies. Below there are 3 Flux kustomizations `postgres`, `postgres-cluster`, and `atuin`. `postgres` is the first app that needs to be running and healthy before `postgres-cluster` and once `postgres-cluster` is healthy `atuin` will be deployed.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  id1>Kustomization: cluster] -->|Creates| id2>Kustomization: cluster-apps];
  id2>Kustomization: cluster-apps] -->|Creates| id3>Kustomization: postgres];
  id2>Kustomization: cluster-apps] -->|Creates| id5>Kustomization: postgres-cluster]
  id2>Kustomization: cluster-apps] -->|Creates| id8>Kustomization: atuin]
  id3>Kustomization: postgres] -->|Creates| id4[HelmRelease: postgres];
  id5>Kustomization: postgres-cluster] -->|Depends on| id3>Kustomization: postgres];
  id5>Kustomization: postgres-cluster] -->|Creates| id10[Postgres Cluster];
  id8>Kustomization: atuin] -->|Creates| id9(HelmRelease: atuin);
  id8>Kustomization: atuin] -->|Depends on| id5>Kustomization: postgres-cluster];
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about three things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios, (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not and (3) The "hit by a bus factor" - what happens to critical apps (e.g. email, password manager, photos) that my family relies on when I no longer around.

Alternative solutions to the first two of these problems would be to host a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud and deploy applications like [HCVault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/), and [Gatus](https://gatus.io/); however, maintaining another cluster and monitoring another group of workloads would be more work and probably be more or equal out to the same costs as described below.
